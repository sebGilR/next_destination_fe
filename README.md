# Next Destination (Front-End)

Next Destination is an app that allows you to browse through the world's top touristic destinations and lets you save them for future reference. An admin user can create, update, and delete destinations.

This is the front-end part of the Next Destination application. This mobile web app is connected to a [Rails API you can find here](https://github.com/sebGilR/next_destination).
